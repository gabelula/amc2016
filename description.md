"Community Technology and Independent Media" Track

Technology is not neutral; technological tools shape much of the organizing and journalism that we do, both online and offline. OpenNews is a Knight-Mozilla organization that helps journalism thrive on and expand in the open web. We are building an ecosystem of tools and programs to strengthen and support the community of developers and journalists in newsrooms. Through workshops, talks, dialogues, skill sharing, and relationship building we aim to help understand how the ecosystem of free software works. We will learn how we can contribute to this ecosystem, discuss strategies for how to appropriate technology, engage in critical analysis of the tools we use and who owns them, explore new organizational forms for technological development, and create a space to explore privacy and security in both our organizations and personal lives.

To accomplish this, we'll bring together community media organizers, journalists, developers to share their experiences and tools of using technology to support their communities. Participants will leave with a brimming toolbox of open source tools, strategies, and a shareable understanding of how to support technology in their communities.
