"Community Technology and Independent Media" Track


Technology is not neutral; technological tools shape much of the organizing and journalism that we do, both online and offline. In the Community Technology and Independent Media track, we aim to help understand the ecosystem of free software, how we can contribute to it, and how we can better use technology in our work. Through workshops, talks, dialogues, skill sharing, and relationship building, we hope to maintain a critical analysis of the tools we use and who owns them. We also want to create a space to explore privacy and security in our organizations and personal lives.

To accomplish this, we'll bring together community media organizers, journalists, designers, developers, and media-makers of any sort to share their experiences and tools of using technology to support their communities. Participants will leave with a brimming toolbox of open source tools, strategies, and a shareable understanding of how to support technology in their communities.
