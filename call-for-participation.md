We are looking for community organizers, coders, journalists, independent media makers, free software activists, security and privacy advocates, and techno-activists! We need you!

The technology we use is shaping how we organize and communicate, and we can shape it too. With this track we will explore how, through building, appropriating and owning our own tools, we can empower the communities we work with.

We are looking for hands-on workshops, meet-ups, skill-sharing sessions, conversations or other session formats to explore questions such as:

- who own the tools we use and what are their goals?
- where is the data we leave on the internet going and how is it being used?
- how are our organizations vulnerable in the web?
- how does culture influence our work in media technology?
- what tools we can use for counter-surveillance?
- which strategies can we develop to appropriate the tools we use?
- what open source tools that allow user-controlled data are available?
- is our community part of the people that make the open web?
- what does "independent" mean in online media?
- how can we reproduce the successes in open source in other tools?
- what new, inclusive organizational forms can be introduced to technological development, and how?

We are looking for session proposals that cover:

- Critical analyses of the tools they are using and who owns them
- Understanding how the ecosystem of free software works and how we can contribute to it
- Knowledge sharing on tools that people and organizations at AMC can use
- Innovative ways of building technology
- Tools and strategies that build community engagement and/or help us understand/share information/data about our communities
- Processes for building inclusive technologies
- Strategies for increasing diversity in technological development
- Building safe spaces online and offline
- Data journalism
