We are looking for community organizers, coders, journalists, independent media makers, free software activists, security and privacy advocates, techno-activists! We need you!

The technology we use is shaping how we organize and communicate. With this track we want to explore how, through building, appropriating, and owning our own tools, we can empower the communities we work with.

We are looking for hands-on workshops, meet-ups, skill-sharing sessions, conversations, or any other format session that can explore questions such as:

- who own the tools we use and what are their goals?
- where are the data and our digital footprints going and how are they being used?
- how vulnerable are our organizations in the web?
- how do cultures influence our work in media technology?
- what tools we can use for resisting surveillance and/or counter-surveillance?
- what strategies can we develop to appropriate the tools we use?
- what open source tools can we use that let us control where the data is stored?
- are our communities included in making the open web?
- what does independent mean in online media?
- the Internet is shaping our societies, but who is shaping the development of the Internet?

We are looking for session proposals that cover:

- Critical analysis of the tools that are used and who owns them
- Understanding on how the ecosystem of free software works and how we can contribute to it
- Knowledge sharing about tools that people and organizations at AMC can use
- Innovative ways of building technology
- Tools and strategies that build community engagement
- Tools and strategies that help us understand/share information/data about our communities
- Building inclusive technologies
- Diversity in technology building
- Building safe spaces online and offline
